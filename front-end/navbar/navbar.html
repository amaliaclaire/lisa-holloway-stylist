            <p>I have been going to Lisa for years after discovering her when I first moved to Seattle. Every haircut and color has been perfect. I leave feeling great and she always finds a way to create a style that grows out well. In addition, she is always happy to try new things that I bring her on a whim (purple hair) and it always ends up looking professional and stylish.

            I absolutely adore her and cannot imagine going anywhere else.</p>

            <p>I have been going to Lisa for years and I cannot express enough how incredible she is. She has been my saving grace. She's honest, professional and incredibly patient. Whenever I have a friend who is keen on looking for a new hairstylist I immediately encourage them to book an appointment. Been loyal for years and will continue to see her every chance I get.</p>

            <p>Lisa is the best!  After moving back to Seattle from a 3-year stint in California, I was on the hunt for a regular stylist who could deal with my thick, wavy, totally out-of-control hair.  Lisa not only managed to give me the cut I wanted, she often made suggestions and changes I would not have thought of that transformed my unruly mushroom hair into a sophisticated, flattering shape.  I receive compliments galore after Lisa cuts my hair - and her price is unbelievably reasonable for her level of expertise.  Plus, she's down to earth, hilarious and fun to talk to.  If you too are searching for a regular stylist who won't let you down, don't hesitate to book an appointment</p>
